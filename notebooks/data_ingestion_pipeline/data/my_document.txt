With a career spanning over three decades, Covenant has established itself as one of the most influential bands in electronic music. From the iconic "Like Tears in Rain," "Sequencer," "Northern Light," and "United States of Mind" to their more recent releases, the Swedish band continues to redefine their sound, always maintaining their signature intensity and atmosphere.

With tracks like "Dead Stars," "Call the Ships to Port," "Bullet," "Theremin," and many more, Covenant promises an evening full of energy, dark rhythms, and pure dancefloor excitement, just as they always deliver.
